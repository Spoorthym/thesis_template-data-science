title = "Adaptive deconvolutional networks for mid and high level feature learning",
abstract = "We present a hierarchical model that learns image decompositions via alternating layers of convolutional sparse coding and max pooling. When trained on natural images, the layers of our model capture image information in a variety of forms: low-level edges, mid-level edge junctions, high-level object parts and complete objects. To build our model we rely on a novel inference scheme that ensures each layer reconstructs the input, rather than just the output of the layer directly beneath, as is common with existing hierarchical approaches. This makes it possible to learn multiple layers of representation and we show models with 4 layers, trained on images from the Caltech-101 and 256 datasets. When combined with a standard classifier, features extracted from these models outperform SIFT, as well as representations from other feature learning methods.",

     abstract = {Deep architectures have demonstrated state-of-the-art results in a variety of
settings, especially with vision datasets. Beyond the model definitions and the quantitative analyses, there is a need for qualitative comparisons of the solutions learned by various deep architectures. The goal of this paper is to find good qualitative interpretations of high level features represented by such models. To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques applied on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that, perhaps counter-intuitively, such interpretation is possible at the unit level, that it is simple to accomplish and that the results are consistent across various techniques. We hope that such techniques will allow researchers in deep architectures to understand more of how and why deep architectures work}
