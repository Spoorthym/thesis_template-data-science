\chapter*{Acknowledgments}


 First and foremost, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to Prof. Dr. Michael Granitzer for his constant supervision, useful comments and engagement through the learning process of this master thesis. He consistently steered me in the right direction. The discussions with Prof. Dr. Granitzer helped me in shaping this thesis. I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for this topic.

I would also like to express my gratitude towards Prof. Dr. Harald kosch for his kind suggestions during the introductory talk. I would also like to thank University of Passau for giving me this opportunity. Last but not the least I would like to thank my family members and friends for their moral support during this thesis.
